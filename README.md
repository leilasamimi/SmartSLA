## SmartSLA: Model-Driven SLA Design and Code Generation Framework

**SmartSLA** is a model-driven engineering (MDE) framework designed to streamline the creation, management, and deployment of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) in cloud environments. This repository provides sample **XMI models**, a **graphical modeling editor**, and **EGL-based code generation templates** to support the complete lifecycle from high-level SLA design to low-level blockchain-based implementation.

### ðŸ”§ Key Components

* **Metamodel (Ecore)**: A comprehensive metamodel defining SLA concepts such as parties, service objectives, penalties, compliance requirements, security constraints, and more.

* **Graphical Editor (Sirius)**: A user-friendly interface for visually constructing SLA models. The editor supports drag-and-drop creation of model elements and produces valid `.xmi` model files conforming to the metamodel.

* **XMI Sample Models**: A collection of SLA models in XMI format representing different cloud service domains (e.g., data analytics, IoT, serverless computing, storage).

* **Model-to-Text Code Generation (EGL)**: Templates written in Eclipse Generation Language (EGL) that transform high-level SLA models into executable Solidity smart contracts for blockchain deployment (e.g., Ethereum).

### ðŸš€ Features

* End-to-end model-driven workflow: from visual modeling to code generation.
* Support for diverse cloud domains and SLA configurations.
* Automatic generation of Solidity smart contracts reduces manual coding effort and potential errors.
* Easily extensible for additional SLA constructs or code targets.



### ðŸ§  Motivation

This project supports researchers and developers in modeling complex SLAs with greater precision and automation. It bridges the gap between SLA design and blockchain deployment, enabling transparent, verifiable, and self-executing agreements in cloud-based ecosystems.
